                <li>While the FDA uses 2,000 as the average number of calories a person should consume in a day, the specific number actually varies for each individual. Factors such as activity level, weight, age, gender, and other variables all need to be taken into consideration.</li>
                 <br>
                <li>It is believed that one-third of Americans are getting nearly half of their daily calories from junk food.</li>
                 <br>
                <li>Calories in our diet come from fat, protein, carbohydrates.  Carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram.  Fat has a whopping 9 calories per gram.</li>
                 <br>
                <li>Ideally, we should consume foods with a relatively high number of nutrients per calorie, or nutrient-dense foods.  Otherwise, we are eating “empty calories”.  Soft drinks are a good example of empty-calorie foods. Nutrient-dense foods include unprocessed food items, fruits, vegetables, etc.</li>
